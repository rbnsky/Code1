## Merge Strategies

**Merge**

  Creates a merge commit that combines changes from one branch into another.

  Retains all individual commits from both branches in the commit history.

  Provides clear information about the branch history.

  Useful for integrating feature branches into the main branch.

**Rebase**

  Moves the head of the current branch to the last commit of the target branch.

  Produces a more linear commit history.

  Replays the changes from the feature branch on top of the target branch.

  Useful for keeping a clean, linear history and avoiding unnecessary merge commits.

**Squash**

  Combines all commits from a feature branch into a single squashed commit.

  Creates a clean linear history but provides less information about individual commits.

  Useful when you want to simplify the commit history and discard the source branch.
